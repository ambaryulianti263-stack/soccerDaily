### Introduction
Chelsea are set to take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in a highly anticipated Premier League match. The Blues, who have been struggling to find their form, are looking to bounce back from their recent defeat and climb up the league table. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace are seeking to cause an upset and gain valuable points to move away from the relegation zone. With the stakes high, this match promises to be an exciting encounter between two teams with different objectives.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Chelsea's recent performances have been marred by inconsistent play and a lack of cohesion among the players. The team's defense has been leaky, and they have struggled to create scoring opportunities. On the other hand, Crystal Palace have been solid at the back, with their defense being one of the most impressive in the league. The Eagles have also been dangerous on the counter-attack, with their pacey wingers causing problems for opposing teams.

In order to win this match, Chelsea will need to improve their defensive solidity and create more scoring opportunities. They will also need to be wary of Crystal Palace's counter-attacks and prevent their wingers from causing damage. The Blues will likely lineup in a 4-3-3 formation, with their star players, including [Kai Havertz](https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/men/squad/kai-havertz) and [Mason Mount](https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/men/squad/mason-mount), leading the charge.
