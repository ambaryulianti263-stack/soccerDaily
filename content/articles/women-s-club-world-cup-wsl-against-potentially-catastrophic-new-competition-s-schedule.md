### Introduction
The Women's Super League (WSL) has expressed its opposition to the proposed schedule for the new Women's Club World Cup, citing concerns that it could have a 'catastrophic' impact on the league. The WSL, which is one of the top women's football leagues in the world, believes that the proposed schedule could lead to a clash with the WSL season, causing a congested schedule for players and potentially harming the league's competitiveness. The Women's Club World Cup, which is set to feature top women's clubs from around the world, is seen as a major development for women's football, but the WSL's concerns highlight the challenges of balancing the growing demand for women's football with the need to protect the integrity of existing leagues.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
The proposed Women's Club World Cup schedule would see the competition take place in the summer, which would coincide with the WSL's offseason. However, the WSL is concerned that the schedule would still have a significant impact on the league, as many of its players would be involved in the competition and would require a break after the tournament. This could lead to a delayed start to the WSL season, which would have a knock-on effect on the rest of the league's schedule. The WSL is also concerned that the Women's Club World Cup would attract many of the league's top players, potentially weakening the league's competitiveness.

### Stats
The WSL has seen significant growth in recent years, with attendance figures and TV viewership increasing steadily. The league has also attracted many of the world's top women's football players, including stars like [Alex Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Morgan) and [Sam Kerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kerr). However, the league's success is still fragile, and the WSL is keen to protect its integrity and competitiveness. The proposed Women's Club World Cup schedule could potentially harm the WSL's growth, as a congested schedule could lead to player burnout and decreased competitiveness.

### Quotes
"We are concerned that the proposed Women's Club World Cup schedule could have a catastrophic impact on the WSL," said a WSL spokesperson. "We understand the importance of the competition, but we need to ensure that it does not harm the integrity of our league. We are working with the relevant authorities to find a solution that works for everyone." The spokesperson added that the WSL is committed to supporting the growth of women's football, but believes that the proposed schedule is not in the best interests of the league or its players.

### Verdict
The dispute over the Women's Club World Cup schedule highlights the challenges of balancing the growing demand for women's football with the need to protect the integrity of existing leagues. While the WSL is keen to support the growth of women's football, it is also determined to protect its own competitiveness and integrity. The proposed schedule may need to be revised to accommodate the WSL's concerns, and it remains to be seen whether a solution can be found that works for all parties involved. One thing is certain, however: the Women's Club World Cup has the potential to be a major development for women's football, and its success will depend on finding a schedule that works for everyone.
