### Introduction
In a thrilling encounter at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal's winless streak grew to 5 games after a 2-3 loss to Manchester United. The Gunners, who have been struggling to find their footing in recent weeks, took an early lead through a well-crafted goal. However, Manchester United's resilience and determination paid off, as they staged a remarkable comeback to claim all three points. The question on everyone's mind is: what's going wrong for Arsenal, and can they turn their season around?

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Arsenal's struggles this season can be attributed to their defensive frailties. The Gunners have conceded an average of 2 goals per game in their last 5 matches, and their inability to keep a clean sheet has cost them dearly. Against Manchester United, Arsenal's defense was breached on multiple occasions, with Marcus Rashford's pace and movement causing them all sorts of problems. On the other hand, Manchester United's attacking trio of Rashford, Anthony Martial, and Bruno Fernandes proved too hot for Arsenal to handle.

### Stats
* Arsenal have now gone 5 games without a win, their longest winless streak in the Premier League since 2019.
* Manchester United have scored 10 goals in their last 3 games, with Rashford scoring 5 of them.
* Arsenal's goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale, has conceded 15 goals in his last 5 games, the most of any goalkeeper in the Premier League during that period.

### Quotes
"We're disappointed with the result, but we can't fault the effort of the players," said Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta. "We need to work on our defensive shape and be more solid at the back. We can't keep conceding goals like we are."
"We showed great character and resilience to come back from a goal down," said Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag. "Marcus Rashford was outstanding, and his goals were the difference between the two teams."

### Verdict
Arsenal's loss to Manchester United marks a significant setback in their quest for a top-four finish. With their winless streak growing, the pressure is mounting on Arteta to turn things around. The Gunners face a tough run of fixtures in the coming weeks, including games against Liverpool and Chelsea. If they can't find a way to shore up their defense and start winning games, their season could be over before it's even begun. For Manchester United, the win marks a significant boost to their top-four hopes, and they will look to build on this momentum in their upcoming games. As for Rashford, his performances have been nothing short of exceptional, and he will be key to Manchester United's chances of success this season.
