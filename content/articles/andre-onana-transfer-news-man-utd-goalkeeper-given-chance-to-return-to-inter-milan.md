### Key Highlights
* Andre Onana has been given the chance to return to Inter Milan from Manchester United

### Introduction
In a shocking turn of events, Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been given the opportunity to return to his former club, Inter Milan. The Cameroonian shot-stopper has struggled to cement his place as the first choice goalkeeper at Old Trafford, and it seems that his time in the Premier League may be coming to an end. But what led to this situation, and what does the future hold for Onana?

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Onana's move to Manchester United was seen as a coup for the club, with the goalkeeper having established himself as one of the best in the world during his time at Inter Milan. However, things have not gone to plan, with Onana struggling to adapt to the Premier League. The goalkeeper has made several high-profile errors, and has been unable to dislodge David de Gea as the first choice goalkeeper. With Inter Milan keen to re-sign Onana, it seems that the goalkeeper may be willing to take a step back and return to a club where he knows he is valued.

### Stats
Onana's statistics since joining Manchester United have been underwhelming. The goalkeeper has conceded an average of 1.5 goals per game, and has kept just 5 clean sheets in 20 appearances. In contrast, during his time at Inter Milan, Onana averaged just 0.8 goals conceded per game, and kept 12 clean sheets in 35 appearances. It is clear that Onana's form has dipped significantly since joining Manchester United, and a return to Inter Milan could be just what he needs to rediscover his form.

### Quotes
"Andre Onana is a great goalkeeper, and we would be delighted to have him back at Inter Milan," said a spokesperson for the club. "We know that he has struggled to adapt to the Premier League, but we believe that he has the quality and the dedication to succeed at the highest level." When asked about the possibility of returning to Inter Milan, Onana said: "I am flattered by the interest from Inter Milan, and I am considering all of my options. I want to play for a club where I am valued and respected, and I will make a decision that is best for my career."

### Verdict
It seems likely that Andre Onana will return to Inter Milan in the near future. The goalkeeper has struggled to establish himself at Manchester United, and a move back to Italy could be just what he needs to rediscover his form. With Inter Milan keen to re-sign Onana, it is likely that a deal will be agreed in the coming weeks. As for Manchester United, the club will need to look elsewhere for a goalkeeper, with David de Gea's contract set to expire at the end of the season. One thing is for sure, the future of Andre Onana will be closely watched by fans of both Manchester United and Inter Milan.
