### Introduction
The Premier League is always full of surprises, and this weekend could be no exception. Wolverhampton Wanderers are hosting Manchester City at Molineux, and while the odds may be against them, there are reasons to believe that Wolves can pull off a major upset. In this article, we will delve into the reasons why Wolves can beat Manchester City and provide our expert analysis on the match.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Manchester City have been in inconsistent form recently, with a series of draws and narrow wins. They have been struggling to find their rhythm, and their defense has been vulnerable to counter-attacks. Wolves, on the other hand, have been in good form, with a series of solid performances against top-six teams. They have a strong record at Molineux, and their counter-attacking style of play could cause problems for Manchester City's defense.

According to [Premier League team news and predicted lineups for Gameweek 23](/articles/premier-league-team-news-and-predicted-lineups-for-gameweek-23-guimaraes-injury-latest-tavernier-ruled-out), Wolves are expected to start with a strong lineup, including Raul Jimenez and Adama Traore. Manchester City, on the other hand, will be without the injured Kevin De Bruyne, which could be a significant blow to their midfield.

### Stats
The stats also suggest that Wolves can cause an upset. In their last five meetings, Wolves have won two and drawn two against Manchester City. They have also scored an average of 1.5 goals per game against top-six teams at Molineux. Manchester City, on the other hand, have conceded an average of 1.2 goals per game against Wolves in their last five meetings.

As [Fabrizio Romano](/articles/fabrizio-romano-transfer-news-arsenal-done-deal-secret-man-utd-target-barcelona-signing-close) reported, Wolves have been one of the most consistent teams in the Premier League this season, and their transfer business has been shrewd. They have a strong squad and a good balance of youth and experience.

### Quotes
"Wolves have been one of the most impressive teams in the Premier League this season," said former Manchester City player, [Tottenham](/articles/burnley-vs-tottenham-live-premier-league-score-match-updates-team-news-and-highlights) legend, Darren Anderton. "They have a strong squad and a good balance of youth and experience. They will be a tough test for Manchester City, and I wouldn't be surprised if they cause an upset."

### Verdict
In conclusion, while Manchester City are the favorites to win this match, there are reasons to believe that Wolves can cause an upset. Their strong record against top-six teams at Molineux, combined with Manchester City's inconsistent form and vulnerable defense, makes this a potentially tricky match for the Premier League champions. As [Arsenal](/articles/champions-league-performance-insights-how-arsenal-passed-their-san-siro-test) showed against [Manchester City](/articles/transfer-centre-live-football-transfer-news-updates-and-rumours) last season, anything can happen in the Premier League, and Wolves will be looking to take advantage of any weaknesses in the Manchester City team.

With the [UEFA Champions League](/articles/uefa-champions-league-2025-26-table-standings-for-the-ucl-league-phase) returning next week, Manchester City will be looking to get back to winning ways before their crucial match against [Juventus vs Benfica](/articles/juventus-vs-benfica-uefa-champions-league-stats-head-to-head). However, Wolves will be no pushover, and this match has all the ingredients of a classic Premier League encounter. As [John Herdman](/articles/prediksi-skuad-timnas-indonesia-racikan-john-herdman-trio-ridho-idzes-hubner-bakal-jadi-kunci-kekuatan) would say, "this is a match that will be decided by the smallest of margins." 

It's going to be an exciting match, and we can't wait to see what happens. Will Wolves cause a major upset, or will Manchester City return to winning ways? Only time will tell.
