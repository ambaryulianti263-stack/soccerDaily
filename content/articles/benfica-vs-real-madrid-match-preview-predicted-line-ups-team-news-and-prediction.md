### Introduction
The Champions League is back, and one of the most highly anticipated matches of the week is Benfica vs Real Madrid. The Portuguese side have been in impressive form this season, and they will be looking to cause an upset against the Spanish giants. Real Madrid, on the other hand, are favorites to win, but they know that they will have to be at their best to come away with all three points. The match is set to be a thrilling encounter, with both teams looking to assert their dominance and come out on top.

The question on everyone's mind is, can Benfica pull off a stunning upset against one of the biggest teams in the world? Or will Real Madrid's quality and experience prove to be too much for the Portuguese side? In this article, we will take a closer look at the two teams, their form, and their chances of winning.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Benfica have been in excellent form this season, and they have been one of the most consistent teams in the Champions League. They have a strong squad, with a good balance of experience and youth, and they have been able to adapt to different situations and opponents. Their home record is particularly impressive, with the team having lost only a few matches at the Estádio da Luz in recent years.

Real Madrid, on the other hand, are one of the biggest teams in the world, with a squad full of superstars. They have a wealth of experience in the Champions League, and they know what it takes to win the competition. However, they have been inconsistent this season, and they have dropped points against weaker opponents.

One of the key factors that could decide the outcome of the match is the battle between Benfica's defense and Real Madrid's attack. Benfica have a solid defense, with a good understanding between the players, and they have been able to keep clean sheets against some of the top teams in the competition. Real Madrid, on the other hand, have a potent attack, with players like [Kylian Mbappé](/articles/villarreal-vs-real-madrid-la-liga-2025-26-mbappe-shines-as-2-0-victory-saw-los-blancos-leapfrog-barcelona) and [Harry Kane](/articles/champions-league-harry-kane-scores-twice-as-bayern-move-into-last-16) who can change the game in an instant.

In terms of head-to-head statistics, the two teams have met each other six times in the past, with Real Madrid winning four of those matches and Benfica winning one. The last time the two teams met was in 2012, when Real Madrid won 2-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu.
