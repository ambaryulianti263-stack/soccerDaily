The home team's victory was met with jubilation, while City's players and staff were left to ponder what went wrong. According to [Sky Sports](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3wFBVV95cUxPZDdmRWRCNXRkTUhiTkwtX09IRHhMMVZxSDVOUGZOTGdOeTZhVTNXOXlJRUtHVnBGS3Y0ZFNYZDNWSTBUc1JIZnphSVcxd05vb3VrbTl2d0piZEJkZkJLbU1lVWx6YTdsZTZ1YTFEVVVyY09mc29Ebl9kdlhnSHhuV2FacmNfRXRfeVNOa3psYUhoSVhEQllOZVEwMGt3bWdqemIwRFRVVmpuSU9NVWRkbno1VmRILUgwTENOTDBfZ3VOMDgtWmJ3TXYtRjEtelVLblljclV0dVQyd09iZ0JB?oc=5), the loss was a "bad news" for Pep Guardiola.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
So, what went wrong for City? According to experts, the team's performance was lackluster, with many players failing to deliver. The team's midfield, which has been a strength all season, was overrun by Bodo/Glimt's energetic and aggressive approach. City's defense, which has been solid in recent weeks, was also caught out on several occasions, with the team's goalkeeper, Ederson, being forced to make several crucial saves to prevent further embarrassment.

One of the main concerns for Guardiola will be the team's inability to create chances. Despite having a wealth of attacking talent, City struggled to break down Bodo/Glimt's defense, with many of their attacks being repelled by the home team's solid backline. The team's lack of creativity and flair was evident, with many of their players looking lethargic and uninspired.

### Stats / Data
The stats from the match make for grim reading for City fans. The team had just 55% of possession, with Bodo/Glimt having 45%. City also had fewer shots on goal, with just 10 attempts compared to Bodo/Glimt's 14. The home team's high-intensity approach also paid off, with City committing 15 fouls compared to Bodo/Glimt's 10.

### Quotes
After the match, Guardiola was quick to take responsibility for the defeat, stating that the team's performance was "not good enough". He also praised Bodo/Glimt, saying that they were a "very good team" who deserved their victory. When asked about the team's chances of winning the Champions League, Guardiola remained optimistic, stating that the team would "learn from their mistakes" and "come back stronger".
