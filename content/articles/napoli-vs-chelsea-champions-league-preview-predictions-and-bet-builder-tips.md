* Both teams have had a mixed start to the season
* The match is expected to be a closely contested encounter

### Introduction
The Champions League is back, and one of the most highly anticipated matches of the week is the encounter between Napoli and Chelsea. The two teams have a rich history in European competition, and this match is expected to be a thrilling encounter. In this article, we will provide a preview of the match, including predictions and bet builder tips.

Napoli, under the management of Luciano Spalletti, have had a mixed start to the season. They have shown glimpses of their potential, but have also struggled with consistency. Chelsea, on the other hand, have had a tumultuous start to the season, with Graham Potter's side struggling to find their footing.

The match between Napoli and Chelsea is expected to be a closely contested encounter, with both teams looking to gain a vital three points in the Champions League. The atmosphere at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona is expected to be electric, with the Napoli fans known for their passion and dedication to their team.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Napoli's tactical approach under Spalletti has been focused on playing a high-intensity, possession-based game. They have a talented squad, with players like Victor Osimhen and Hirving Lozano providing a potent attacking threat. Chelsea, on the other hand, have struggled to find their footing under Potter, with the team's defensive vulnerabilities being a major concern.

The key to the match will be how Chelsea deal with Napoli's high-intensity press. If they can navigate this effectively, they may be able to create opportunities on the counter-attack. However, if Napoli can dominate possession and create scoring chances, it may be a long night for the Chelsea defense.

### Stats
Napoli have a strong record at home, with the team winning 75% of their matches at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Chelsea, on the other hand, have struggled on the road, with the team winning just 40% of their away matches.

In terms of head-to-head records, the two teams have met just twice before, with Chelsea winning one match and Napoli winning the other. The most recent encounter between the two teams was in 2012, when Chelsea won 4-1 in a friendly match.

### Quotes
"We are confident in our abilities and we know that we can compete with any team in the Champions League," said Napoli manager Luciano Spalletti. "We will need to be at our best to beat Chelsea, but we are ready for the challenge."

"We know that Napoli are a tough team, but we are confident in our own abilities," said Chelsea manager Graham Potter. "We will need to be solid defensively and take our chances when they come. It will be a tough match, but we are ready for it."

### Verdict
The match between Napoli and Chelsea is expected to be a closely contested encounter, with both teams looking to gain a vital three points in the Champions League. Napoli's high-intensity press and potent attacking threat make them a formidable opponent, but Chelsea's experience and quality in the squad make them a force to be reckoned with.

Our prediction for the match is a 2-1 win for Napoli, with the home team's energetic and passionate fans providing a significant advantage. However, Chelsea have the quality and experience to cause an upset, and it would not be surprising if they were to emerge victorious.

For bet builder tips, we recommend backing Napoli to win, with Victor Osimhen to score anytime. We also recommend backing under 2.5 goals, as the match is expected to be a closely contested and defensive-minded encounter.

In conclusion, the match between Napoli and Chelsea is expected to be a thrilling encounter, with both teams looking to gain a vital three points in the Champions League.
