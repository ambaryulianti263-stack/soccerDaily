As we approach the knockout phase, the stakes are getting higher, and teams are battling it out for a place in the next round.

### Tactical Analysis
One of the key factors that has contributed to the success of top teams like Bayern Munich and Liverpool is their strong squad depth and tactical flexibility. These teams have been able to adapt to different opponents and situations, using a variety of formations and player combinations to outmaneuver their rivals. For example, Liverpool's use of a 4-3-3 formation has allowed them to dominate possession and create scoring opportunities, while Bayern Munich's 4-2-3-1 setup has given them a strong defensive base and quick counter-attacking threat.

In contrast, some teams have struggled with injuries and squad depth issues, which has hindered their progress in the competition.
