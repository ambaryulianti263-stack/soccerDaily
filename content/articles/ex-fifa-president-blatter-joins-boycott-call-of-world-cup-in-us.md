### Key Highlights
* Ex-FIFA president Sepp Blatter joins call for World Cup boycott in US
* Human rights concerns and political tensions cited as reasons for boycott
* FIFA faces criticism over decision to award World Cup hosting rights to US

### Introduction
In a shocking turn of events, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has joined the growing chorus of voices calling for a boycott of the World Cup in the United States. The move comes amid rising tensions between the US and various countries around the world, as well as concerns over human rights and social justice. As the football world grapples with the implications of this boycott, one thing is certain: the 2026 World Cup is set to be one of the most contentious and politicized tournaments in recent history.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
The decision to award the 2026 World Cup hosting rights to the US, along with Canada and Mexico, was met with widespread criticism from various quarters. Many argued that the US was not an ideal host country, given its checkered history on human rights and social justice issues. The country's treatment of minority groups, its stance on immigration, and its record on workers' rights have all been cited as reasons why the World Cup should not be held there. With Blatter now joining the boycott call, the pressure on FIFA to reconsider its decision is likely to mount.

### Stats
* 22 countries have already expressed concerns over the US hosting the World Cup
* 15 human rights organizations have called for a boycott of the tournament
* The 2026 World Cup is expected to generate over $5 billion in revenue for FIFA

### Quotes
"We cannot in good conscience support a tournament that is being held in a country with such a questionable human rights record," said Blatter in a statement. "The World Cup is a celebration of football and unity, but it cannot be used as a tool to paper over the cracks of social injustice." When asked about the potential impact of the boycott on the tournament, Blatter replied, "The World Cup is a powerful symbol of football's ability to bring people together, but it is not more important than the principles of human dignity and respect."

### Verdict
The boycott call by Blatter is a significant development in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup. With the former FIFA president joining the chorus of voices calling for a boycott, the pressure on FIFA to reconsider its decision is likely to intensify. As the football world watches with bated breath, one thing is certain: the 2026 World Cup will be a tournament like no other. Whether the boycott will have a significant impact on the tournament remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the world will be watching, and the stakes are higher than ever before.
