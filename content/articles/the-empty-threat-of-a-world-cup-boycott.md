### Introduction
The announcement of the US as the host country for the FIFA World Cup 2026 was met with a mixture of excitement and controversy. While many see the US as an ideal location for the tournament, others have raised concerns over the country's suitability to host such a high-profile event. One of the most vocal critics is ex-FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who has joined the call for a boycott of the tournament. But what are the reasons behind this boycott, and is it a credible threat?

### Tactical Analysis / Context
The boycott call is largely driven by concerns over the US's human rights record, as well as its stance on various international issues. However, many experts believe that the boycott is an empty threat, with few countries likely to follow through on their promises. The FIFA World Cup is a highly prestigious event, and many countries will be eager to participate, regardless of their political differences with the host country. Furthermore, the US provides a unique platform for the tournament, with its state-of-the-art stadiums and large, enthusiastic fan base.

### Stats
The FIFA World Cup 2026 is expected to be one of the most widely viewed events in history, with the US providing a unique platform for the tournament. The event is expected to attract a global audience of over 3.5 billion people, with the final match alone expected to draw in over 1.5 billion viewers. The tournament will also feature 48 teams, up from the 32 teams that participated in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

### Quotes
"We are calling for a boycott of the FIFA World Cup 2026 in the US, due to the country's human rights record and its stance on various international issues," said ex-FIFA President Sepp Blatter. "However, we understand that this is a complex issue, and many countries may choose to participate despite their reservations."

"I think the boycott is an empty threat, and most countries will choose to participate in the tournament," said John Herdman, coach of the Canadian national team. "The FIFA World Cup is a unique opportunity for countries to come together and celebrate the beautiful game, and I think most countries will put their political differences aside to participate."

### Verdict
In conclusion, while the boycott call for the FIFA World Cup 2026 is a significant development, it is largely seen as an empty threat. The FIFA World Cup is a highly prestigious event, and many countries will be eager to participate, regardless of their political differences with the host country. The US provides a unique platform for the tournament, with its state-of-the-art stadiums and large, enthusiastic fan base. As the tournament approaches, it will be interesting to see how the boycott call affects the event, and whether any countries choose to follow through on their promises. For now, however, it seems that the FIFA World Cup 2026 will go ahead as planned, with the US hosting one of the most widely viewed events in history.
