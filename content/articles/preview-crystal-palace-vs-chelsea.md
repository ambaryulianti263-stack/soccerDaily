The Eagles have been in impressive form lately, with three consecutive unbeaten matches in the league, while the Blues are looking to bounce back from a disappointing defeat to Nottingham Forest. In this article, we will take a closer look at the two teams, their current form, and provide a prediction for the match.

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Crystal Palace have been one of the surprise packages of the season so far, with their solid defensive record and exciting attacking play. The Eagles have a strong squad with a good balance of experience and youth, and they have been able to grind out results against tough opponents. On the other hand, Chelsea have been struggling to find consistency this season, with a mix of impressive wins and disappointing defeats. The Blues have a talented squad, but they have been unable to click into gear, and their recent defeat to Nottingham Forest was a major setback.

### Stats
Crystal Palace have a strong record against Chelsea at Selhurst Park, with three wins and two draws in their last six matches against the Blues. The Eagles have also been solid defensively, with only two defeats in their last 10 matches in all competitions. Chelsea, on the other hand, have been struggling away from home, with only two wins in their last six matches on the road.

### Verdict
Based on the current form of the two teams, we predict a narrow win for Crystal Palace. The Eagles have been solid defensively, and they have the attacking talent to cause problems for Chelsea.

We expect a tight and intense match, but ultimately, we think Crystal Palace will come out on top.
