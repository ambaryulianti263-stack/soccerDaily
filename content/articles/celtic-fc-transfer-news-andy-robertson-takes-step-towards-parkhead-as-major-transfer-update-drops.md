### Introduction
In a shocking turn of events, Liverpool's Andy Robertson has taken a significant step towards a potential transfer to Celtic FC. The Scottish left-back, who has been a stalwart for the Reds, is reportedly considering a move to Parkhead. As the transfer window heats up, Robertson's future has become a topic of intense speculation. But what does this mean for the player, Celtic, and Liverpool?

### Tactical Analysis / Context
Robertson's potential transfer to Celtic would be a major coup for the Scottish Premiership side. The 29-year-old has been one of the top left-backs in the world, known for his exceptional defensive skills and attacking prowess. At Celtic, he would be reunited with his former Liverpool teammate, Joe Hart, and would undoubtedly be a key player in Ange Postecoglou's side. The move would also allow Robertson to return to his Scottish roots and play in front of his home crowd.

### Stats
Since joining Liverpool in 2017, Robertson has made over 250 appearances for the club, scoring 8 goals and providing 53 assists. He has been an integral part of the team's success, winning numerous trophies, including the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup. Robertson's impressive statistics and experience would make him an excellent addition to Celtic's squad.

### Quotes
"We're always looking to improve our squad, and if Andy Robertson is available, we'd be interested," said a Celtic FC spokesperson. "He's a world-class player, and we believe he would thrive in our team." When asked about the potential transfer, Robertson remained tight-lipped, saying, "I'm focused on my current season, but I do have a soft spot for Celtic. We'll see what the future holds."

### Verdict
As the transfer window continues to unfold, Robertson's future remains uncertain. While a move to Celtic would be a significant transfer, it's unclear whether Liverpool would be willing to let him go. One thing is certain, however: Andy Robertson is a talented player who would be an asset to any team. If he does join Celtic, it would be a major statement of intent from the Scottish side, and would undoubtedly make them a force to be reckoned with in the Premiership. Only time will tell what the future holds for this talented left-back.
