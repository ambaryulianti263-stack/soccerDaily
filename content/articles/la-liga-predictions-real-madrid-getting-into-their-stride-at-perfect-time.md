The introduction of new players, such as Aurelien Tchouameni and Antonio Rudiger, has also added depth and quality to the squad.

Karim Benzema, the team's star striker, has been in scintillating form, scoring seven goals in his last eight appearances. Vinicius Junior, the young Brazilian winger, has also been a revelation, providing six assists and scoring three goals in his last ten games.
